# Budjot ðŸ’°
Budjot is a simple budgeting application which I wrote for fun and profit. The original incarnation was a NodeJS server, with an Angular front-end. The current incarnation is a Clojure API, with the same Angular front-end. One day, I hope to re-write the front-end in Clojurescript, thus completing my journey as a Lisp padawan.

Budjot is available for public use at [budjot.com](https://www.budjot.com), and requires logging in with a Google account (which makes my usage of it simple).

## Local development
### Backend
The backend API is written in Clojure, and is responsible for CRUD operations to "jot" resources, and for serving the static files of the frontend.

#### Running the tests
Tests can be run from the command line with:

```sh
lein test
```

> ðŸ’¡ Most test pass at the moment for the critical paths of the application, such as creating resources and saving them in the database. Some are failing, and some are missing for unimplemented resources of HTTP verbs.

#### Running locally
The entire application can be run locally using `docker-compose` by running:

```sh
make docker-up
```

> ðŸ’¡ At the moment, this simply runs the API on port 8080, which only serves a sample HTML file, and some basic endpoints for the "jot" resource.

### Frontend
The frontend is an Angular project written in Typescript. It is several years old, and does not currently build from scratch.

#### Building
The frontend can be built with:

```sh
make build-ui
```

> ðŸ’¡ As noted above, the frontend does not currently build with these instructions due to it being several years out of date.

## TODOs
The following main items need to be completed to make this project operational on this branch:

- [ ] Build the frontend Angular project into static HTML and Javascript files in the `resources/` directory.
- [ ] Implement missing HTTP verbs for the "jot" resource (i.e. `PUT` and `DELETE`).
- [ ] Implement the "users" resource.
- [ ] Implement the login route, and add Google OAuth authentication.

## Releases
